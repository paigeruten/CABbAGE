a Ruby DSL for making songs in the midi format.

it's designed for entering the notes of a song into the computer speedily and tidily.

i use it for learning music theory and stuff.

it depends on midilib. midilib is good. :)

better documentation coming soon, probably. for now look in the examples folder to get an idea.

well, see you around.
